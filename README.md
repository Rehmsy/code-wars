## Regex validate PIN code
Sarah only (this was assigned end of day 06/05 and then I was out sick on 06/06)

ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.
